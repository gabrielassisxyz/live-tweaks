# live-tweaks — backlog (drain queue)

> Materialized from `PLAN.md` (2026-07-17 planning round). Backend: markdown, per
> AGENTS.md. Pull top-down within a track. After P1, **Track A** (P2–P4) and
> **Track B** (P5) are independent — they share only PLAN §4 + D3/D10, all pinned.
>
> **Process**: one branch per track (`feature/panel`, `feature/tweaks-skill`);
> AGENTS.md's review gate (one independent review of the whole branch diff) applies
> per branch, pre-push. Done = checked here + `bin/ci` green + the task's verify
> step shown + AGENTS.md post-implementation checklist.
>
> **HUMAN CHECKPOINT** = the verify is visual/interactive: stop and ask Gabriel to
> confirm; never self-declare a pass.

## P1 — extraction core

- [ ] **T1** `src/extract.ts` — recursive walker per PLAN D2: rule-type switch
      (style/media/supports/layer/nested), `CSSImportRule` recursion with own
      try/catch, `document.adoptedStyleSheets`, cross-origin skip counter; custom
      props read via CSSOM iteration (`style.item` + `getPropertyValue`), never by
      splitting `cssText`. TDD: authored-string + jsdom fixtures incl. adversarial
      values (`;`/`}` inside strings, comments). *(depends: —)*
- [ ] **T2** active-value resolution (trimmed `getComputedStyle`), root-level
      flagging (PLAN D3), multi-definition dedupe, computed-style supplementary
      enumeration, and the **`before` algorithm** (PLAN §4, all 3 branches). Tests
      incl. authored≠computed case (hex authored, `rgb(…)` computed via var()
      chain). Checkpoint: jsdom capability probe — if custom props don't survive
      jsdom CSSOM, swap to `happy-dom` and note in AGENTS.md (PLAN D8).
      *(depends: T1)*
- [ ] **T3** `src/classify.ts` — color / font-family / length / other per PLAN D5
      (trimmed input; font requires name match; `calc()`/unitless excluded →
      other). Table-driven tests. *(depends: T1)*
- [ ] **T4** `src/state.ts` — baseline (raw+resolved per token), pre-existing
      inline snapshot (PLAN D12), overrides, `diff()` in contract format,
      `reset(name)`/`resetAll()` restoring snapshot values. TDD. *(depends: T2, T3)*

## P2 — panel shell (Track A)

- [ ] **T5** `src/apply.ts` + `src/main.ts` + build config — init idempotency
      guard, `window.LiveTweaks.{dump, rescan}`; vite `formats: ["iife","es"]` +
      package.json `exports`/`module` (PLAN D14; UMD forbidden). Verify:
      `npm run build`, serve `demo/` over http, `LiveTweaks.dump()` lists exactly
      the fixture's root tokens with correct kinds and skip counters.
      *(depends: T4, T6)*
- [ ] **T6** `demo/index.html` + `demo/tokens.css` — kernl-mirroring fixture per
      PLAN D7: tokens inside `@layer`, an `@media` override, an `@import`ed sheet,
      a component-scoped var, `--tw-*` noise, a `var()` reference, a
      semicolon-in-string value, a `[data-theme]` dark block. *(depends: —)*
- [ ] **T7** **SPIKE/GATE (~2h box)** — Tweakpane 4.0.5 in Shadow DOM on the demo
      page: mount, style-clone workaround (issue #535), color-picker popup
      click-drag stays open, keyboard focus works (PLAN D1). Record outcome in
      AGENTS.md; on fail, `panel.ts` impl = native inputs behind the same
      interface. *(depends: T6)*
- [ ] **T8** `src/panel/host.ts` + `src/panel/panel.ts` — floating Shadow DOM host
      (bottom-right, max z-index, collapse), `TweaksPanel` interface, folders per
      kind, controls per PLAN D5, Rescan button. *(depends: T5, T7)*

## P3 — live editing (Track A)

- [ ] **T9** edit wiring: control change → apply → state; per-var reset +
      reset-all (PLAN D12). **HUMAN CHECKPOINT**: SCOPE success-check #2 on the
      demo page (color + font update live as you type). *(depends: T8)*

## P4 — save / export (Track A)

- [ ] **T10** `src/export.ts` — Save → contract JSON (PLAN §4) → clipboard;
      fallback modal triggers on promise *rejection*, not only API absence. Unit
      verify: session with 2 edits + 1 reset exports exactly the 2, `before` =
      raw authored text. *(depends: T9)*

## P5 — `/tweaks` skill (Track B — needs only PLAN §4 + D3/D10)

- [ ] **T11** `skills/tweaks/SKILL.md` — *setup*, token-having paths: read
      `design.md` if present; missing/stale → rescan source, rewrite wholesale
      (PLAN D10); end printing injection instructions (script tag + dev-gated
      `import('live-tweaks')`). Verify: run against `demo/` finds the fixture
      tokens, writes correct `design.md`. *(depends: —)*
- [ ] **T12** *setup*, no-vars path: detect hardcoded values, explain the
      constraint, offer interactive refactor-to-vars (file-by-file, small diffs).
      Verify: run against a hardcoded-colors fixture page produces the
      explanation + a concrete refactor offer. *(depends: T11)*
- [ ] **T13** *implement* mode: parse diff JSON, locate definitions, apply PLAN D3
      anchor rule (ambiguous → stop and ask), edit files, show diff summary.
      Verify: hand-written diff JSON applied to the demo fixture edits the right
      definitions, incl. the `[data-theme]` anchor case and a stop-and-ask case.
      *(depends: T11)*
- [ ] **T14** `README.md` — what / install (npm + skill symlink) / inject
      snippets / limitations (PLAN D4, D6, CSP, rescan). Minimal and honest;
      polish at `/public-repo`. *(depends: T13)*

## P6 — validation + release

- [ ] **T15** kernl end-to-end — SCOPE success checks 1–3. kernl:
      `~/repositories/kernl`, web app under `web/`, run per kernl's own AGENTS.md.
      **HUMAN CHECKPOINT** on the visual steps; every breakage fixed with a
      regression test; PLAN D13 usability gate evaluated here.
      *(depends: T10, T13)*
- [ ] **T16** demo-page end-to-end — SCOPE success check 4 (framework-agnosticism
      proof). **HUMAN CHECKPOINT.** *(depends: T15 — sequencing choice per SCOPE's
      "repeat steps 1–3", not a hard dependency)*
- [ ] **T17** release — manual first `npm publish` as **v1.0.0** (2FA), then
      configure npm Trusted Publisher (org `gabrielassisxyz`, repo `live-tweaks`,
      workflow `release.yml`) per AGENTS.md. *(depends: T14, T16)*
